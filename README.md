## YOLOv3 use MobileNet

Inspired by [qqwweee/keras-yolo3](https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3) and [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861).

### How to start

You can do same things like [**keras-yolo3**](<https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3>) mentioned because I modified backbone network and keep training and testing process interface.
